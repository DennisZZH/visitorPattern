Comments: The way i deal with maxVisitor is that i set the max variable initially to the value of the root. To do this, i modify the constructor of maxVisitor to let it take one parameter, the root pointer. I also modify the main function accordingly when calling the constructor of maxVisitor.  All tests passed.
